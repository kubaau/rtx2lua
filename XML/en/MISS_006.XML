The Vikings have a settlement behind the large mountain range on the east of our island. From the peaks of the mountains, one can see another very large land mass in the northeast.



 We have not yet found any trace of a gateway and the prisoners of war claim they know of no such thing, but they are poor liars.

We have captured the small area of land beyond the mountain chain from the Vikings.
We took further prisoners who told us where the gateway is. As we already suspected, it is in the far northeast.
Apart from a small area in the south of the land mass, it is entirely in the hands of the Vikings. We must quickly build a harbor there and acquire fresh supplies.
