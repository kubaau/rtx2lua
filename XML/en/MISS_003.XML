17th Day of the Third Month of the 3rd Year.

We have now created something of a routine in establishing a viable settlement. Everything should now work like clockwork.

We came across another castaway. He warned us against hostile Nubian tribes in the east of the island. The mountains in the east also allegedly have large quantities of gold. The man knew nothing about a gateway but he was only familiar with a small part of the island.

23rd Day of the 12th Month of the 3rd Year.

We came into contact with the Nubians. Their behavior is very threatening but not openly aggressive. Their behavior will probably change before long. We should build a lookout tower so that we can keep a closer eye on their lands.

The reports of rich gold deposits seem to be true. The Nubian chieftain struts around in his gold jewelry like a peacock.

We have reached the gateway and activated it. We know not where our next step will take us, but we shall go on.
